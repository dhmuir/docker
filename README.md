# ``docker`` Repository

The ``docker`` repository contains image Dockerfile and service docker-compose files for various uses.

The ``image`` directory contains the image Dockerfiles by image name; they should be descriptive enough.

The ``services`` directory contains service docker-compose files for services and would be typical
of how to run the Docker images.
